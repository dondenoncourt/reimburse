### Reimburse project

#### A few rules:
* First day and last day of a project, or sequence of projects, is a travel day.
* Any day in the middle of a project, or sequence of projects, is considered a full day.
* If there is a gap between projects, then the days on either side of that gap are travel days.
* If two projects push up against each other, or overlap, then those days are full days as well.
* Any given day is only ever counted once, even if two projects are on the same day.
* A travel day is reimbursed at a rate of 45 dollars per day in a low cost city.
* A travel day is reimbursed at a rate of 55 dollars per day in a high cost city.
* A full day is reimbursed at a rate of 75 dollars per day in a low cost city.
* A full day is reimbursed at a rate of 85 dollars per day in a high cost city.

#### TODO
* add a readme
